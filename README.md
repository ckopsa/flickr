# flickr — media server PoC

A proof-of-concept media server over an S3/MinIO bucket, built to demonstrate
a handful of architectural decisions (see design notes below):

1. **Pure-function playback decisions** — `internal/decision.Decide(media, caps, policy)`
   is side-effect-free, table-tested, and every decision returns a trace
   answering "why did this transcode?" (shown in the UI).
2. **Versioned capability negotiation** — clients declare what they can play
   (`ClientCapabilities`, `schema_version` field); the server never hardcodes
   device models.
3. **Isolated FFmpeg boundary** — `internal/pipeline` is the only package that
   knows FFmpeg exists. `BuildArgs` (job → argv) is pure and unit-tested;
   sessions own the subprocess and HLS output.
4. **Split storage** — `data/library.db` (mostly-static metadata) and
   `data/state.db` (high-churn playback positions) are separate SQLite files,
   both WAL; a scan can never lock out position writes.
5. **Incremental, job-based scanning** — list bucket → diff etags → probe only
   changed objects (bounded worker pool) → batch-write in transactions →
   reconcile deletions. Restarting never re-probes the whole library.
6. **Identification ≠ enrichment** — object key → identity is deterministic
   and separately stored; user overrides (`POST /api/items/{id}/identity`) are
   never clobbered by a rescan. Identification is directory-aware
   (`Shows/<name>/Season <n>/`, `Movies/<Name (Year)>/`) and versioned:
   bumping `IdentityVersion` makes the next scan recompute identities from
   keys alone — no re-probe, no bandwidth. TMDB enrichment (title, overview,
   poster) is a separate post-scan stage keyed off identity; enrichment is
   invalidated automatically when an item's identity changes, and disabled
   entirely without a `TMDB_API_KEY`.
7. **Verified hardware-accel detection** — at startup the pipeline probes
   nvenc/qsv/vaapi/v4l2m2m with real test encodes (compiled-in ≠ working)
   and keeps the full accept/reject trace (`GET /api/system`). The decision
   engine stays hardware-agnostic; encoder choice happens at the FFmpeg
   boundary, including per-family quirks (preset namespaces, vaapi hwupload).
8. **Self-maintaining sessions and scans** — transcode sessions track when
   their HLS output was last fetched; a reaper stops sessions idle >5 minutes
   (vanished clients never say goodbye). Scans run on a schedule
   (`SCAN_INTERVAL`, default 12h; an empty library triggers one at startup),
   and probing now extracts subtitle streams; text tracks are served as
   WebVTT (`.vtt` endpoint, extracted on demand with ffmpeg, cached in
   `data/subs/`), bitmap tracks are listed but marked unsupported.
9. **Profiles and telemetry stay lightweight** — user profiles are names in
   `state.db` (`/api/users`); clients pass the profile name as `client_id` to
   the unchanged progress API. `POST /api/telemetry` appends any JSON object
   to `data/telemetry.jsonl` for client-side error forensics.

## Run

```sh
cp .env.example .env   # fill in MinIO credentials
go run ./cmd/server
# open http://localhost:8080, hit "Scan library"
```

Requires `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` on PATH. Media files are read straight from MinIO
via presigned URLs — both for probing and as FFmpeg input; nothing is copied
locally except HLS segments in `data/streams/`.

## API

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/scan`, `GET /api/scan` | trigger / observe incremental scan (enrichment runs after) |
| `GET /api/items` | library listing (incl. `media_info.subtitles` and `enrichment`) |
| `POST /api/items/{id}/decision` | dry-run: decision + trace, no side effects |
| `POST /api/items/{id}/play` | decide and act: presigned URL (direct) or HLS session (transcode) |
| `POST /api/items/{id}/identity` | user identity override (persists across scans) |
| `POST /api/items/{id}/reprobe` | re-probe one item on demand |
| `POST /api/items/{id}/enrich` | TMDB-enrich one item on demand (503 if no API key) |
| `GET /api/items/{id}/subtitles/{ordinal}.vtt` | subtitle track as WebVTT (415 for bitmap tracks, 404 for bad ordinal) |
| `GET /api/items/{id}/poster` | cached TMDB poster (image/jpeg, 404 if absent) |
| `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}` | stop a transcode session (idle sessions are auto-reaped) |
| `POST/GET /api/progress` | playback position per (item, client) |
| `GET/POST /api/users` | list / idempotently create profile names (clients use the name as `client_id`) |
| `POST /api/telemetry` | append any JSON object to `data/telemetry.jsonl`; always 200 |

`decision`/`play` take `{"capabilities": {...}, "client_id": "...", "seek_seconds": 0}`.
The web UI includes capability presets (Chromecast v1, 4K HDR TV, cellular cap)
to demonstrate how the same file direct-plays or transcodes per client.

## Casting

The web UI is a Google Cast sender: the cast icon in the control row streams
to a Chromecast running the default media receiver, and the page becomes the
remote (play/pause, ±seek, volume, stop, scrub bar, chapter jumps). While a
cast session is active the client sends the *Chromecast Ultra's* capability
manifest — the decision engine negotiates for the device that actually plays,
not the browser.

Plumbing that makes it work:
- HLS segment format is **negotiated** via `hls_segment_formats` in the
  capability manifest: TS is the floor (some Android-TV cast receivers
  reject fMP4 outright), fMP4 is used when the stream carries HEVC (which
  cannot ride in TS); a TS-only client asking for HEVC gets an h264
  re-encode, with the reason in the trace.
- The server advertises a LAN-reachable `base_url` (`GET /api/system`;
  override with `ADVERTISE_URL`) since the device can't resolve localhost.
- Permissive CORS on stream routes (the receiver fetches cross-origin).

Caveat: the Cast sender SDK needs Chrome and a secure context — open the UI
at `http://localhost:8099` (localhost counts as secure) or put it behind
HTTPS; a plain `http://<lan-ip>` page won't show the cast button.

`scripts/cast_harness.py` (needs `.venv` with pychromecast) drives a real
cast device end-to-end without a browser: discovers via mDNS, gets a play
decision, loads the URL, and asserts on the receiver's own status channel.
`--url` casts an arbitrary URL as a control test. Exits 0/1 for CI use.
The server must be reachable from the LAN — check the host firewall
(this was once a silent `ufw` DROP; stream fetches are logged for exactly
this kind of diagnosis).

## Tests

```sh
go test ./...
```

Decision-engine tests cover the canonical matrix cases (e.g. 4K HEVC HDR10 +
h264-only client → tone-mapped, downscaled h264 transcode); pipeline tests
pin the FFmpeg argv contract (filter order, seek-before-input, copy paths).
